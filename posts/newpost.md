The sun is out and warmer weather has arrived! So let's get your skin prepped and ready for your makeup-free glow.

It's no doubt we recommend regular maintenance from our skin specialists to keep that natural healthy glow. We have an array of skin treatments to offer you depending on the time and care needed. But I bet you're thinking... what does a facial REALLY do for my face?

Getting a regular (monthly) facial means that you're:

Removing dead skins cells. Gross, right? While completely normal to have, and part of our skin's natural cycle, the dead skin cell layer sitting on top of our skin can take a toll on your complexion. Maintaining this with a monthly dermaplaning facial can give your skin the best chance for product absorption and glow.
Clearing clogged pores. Remember those dead skin cells? They're clogging your pores along with the dirt and grime from life. Our deep cleansing facial is a great way to get rid of the acne-causing, pore-clogging bacteria and give your skin those natural beams of light.
Improving blood circulation, releasing toxins, and improving fine lines and wrinkles. That pretty much says it all lol. Every single one of our facials includes a massage to do just that: blood flow, lymphatic drainage and get you completely relaxed.
Don't wait till it's too late. Book your next facial treatment and bask in the summer glow!
